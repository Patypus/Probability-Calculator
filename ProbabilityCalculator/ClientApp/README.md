This is the client side of the probability calculator and it is recommended that the application is run as a whole from the .sln file at the root of the repo as the UI starting without the C# API will be limited in functionality.

Useful commands to run from here are:

`npm test`

Which launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

`npm run lint`
Which lints the js code and highlights styling issues.

#### Ejecting CRA 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and uses the default setup. Large changes to the configuration can be made after running the eject command, although this is a one way process. I include this for future reference but this project should never become complicated enough to require this

`npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
